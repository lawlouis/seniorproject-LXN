## Summary of Our Approach to Software Development

[What processes are we following?  What are we choosing to do and at what level of detail or extent?]

## Initial Vision Statment
Music Booking
For musicians and venues who need an easy way to book shows, the show booking application is a useful web application that will allow musicians and venues to search for and contact each other. This will make for a much smoother booking process and will aid venues and musicians in discovering one another. Unlike other booking applications, our product will be truly representative of, and useful to, the independent music scene in the Salem area.

Culture
For students/travelers/teachers who need or interested in learning new cultures before they travel or for the sake of diversity, the Culture Learning application is a website that will provide information of different cultures such as food, languages, history, landmarks, etc. The website will have a main search functionality and categories for visitors to look for a specific culture that they are interested in learning. This website will also act as a social media for people to exchange their culture with multimedia. Unlike a typical language learning website, our application will generate a lot of more info than just languages and will also be able to help people with different purpose of learning such as traveling or educational purposes.

## Initial Requirements Elaboration and Elicitation

### Questions


### Interviews

### Other Elicitation Activities?

## List of Needs and Features

1. Musicians and venues owners should be able to create accounts.
2. Users should have profiles to display their description, name, location, contact information, videos, and photos. They should have a profile picture and a display name. If it is a band's profile, every member should be listed.
3. Users should be able to show their schedule on their profiles so other users can see when they are available.
4. Implement a rating system so users can rate each other after they work together.
5. A search feature should be implemented so users can search for each other. Include filters: by distance, genre, name, rating, or whether the musician has videos, popularity (or no filters - alphabetical).
6. Reccomendation algorithm that will suggest musicians/venues based on previous bookings.
7. We need to use YouTube API to display videos on musicians' profile. We could possibly use instagram and soundcloud as well.
8. Display map & "distance from you" on venues' profiles. We will use a GPS API for this.
