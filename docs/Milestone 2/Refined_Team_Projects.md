# Refined Project Ideas
**Answer Questions below for projects**

* What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
* Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?
* What are a few major features?
* What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.
* What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)
* Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.

### 1. Language/Culture Learning Application

This language/culture learning application is more than just learning languages. What's new about this idea is that this application will give you a more in depth culture learning/exchanhe that can be applied to traveling or intercultural communication. The related website would be something like DuoLingo. However, Duolingo is a website that focuses on linguistic learning. 

This application can be useful to a lot of people like local students or teachers who want to explore different cultures for their schoolworks. For pleasure use, people can explore cultures before they travel. For example, if you want to learn some conversation in a specific language, or some do/don't do in different cultures. 

One major feature is to search for a culture/language, and output data about that culture. It may include information like things you need to know before you travel, useful conversation in that language. Another potential major feature is acting like a specific social media for exchanging culture. Users will be able to connect with people from a culture that they are interested in. It could be a search for a local tour guide or like a forum or blogs for people to interact and ask questions, share their thoughts about cultures or languages.

Some potential features that we can add:
* An API that accquires information of purchasing flight tickets
* Youtube API for travel vlogs or videos about cultures
* An API that generate a graph of flight ticket price changes

One algorithmic content that I can think of is a shopping list with conversion of different currencies. For example, if you are traveling somewhere in Europe, you can create a shopping list to calculate the total in your original currency and any other useful calculations that users might be interested in.

This topic can be very easy or difficult depending on the features that we are going to implement. For an initial prediction, I will rate this project a 7 out of 10.

### 2. Music Gig Booking Application
This would be a website where musicians and people who own venues can create accounts and find each other. A musician's page would show their name or band name, an about me, contact information, music genre, and videos or audio of performances shared from Youtube, Instagram, or SoundCloud. A venue's page would show the name of the venue, location, contact information, some photos, and optionally a brief description of the atmosphere there and what they are looking for in a live entertainer. I would also like to display the venue's location on a map. We should incorporate a rating system for both performers and venue owners. If a musician books a show through our website, the musician and venue owner can rate their experiences working with one another. It would be useful to display musicians' and venues' schedules as well, so that they may more easily find dates and times that work when booking shows. They should be able to message each other through the application as well.


There are a few websites like this already. Although, everything I have found only allows musicians to create profiles, there are no venue profiles. This means that only venue owners can do the searching. In our application, both venue owners and musicians can search for each other, which would be helpful for musicians aren't very well known, or play shows as a source of income. Also, in contrast to these existing sites, ours would be much more geared toward the real independent music scene in the Salem/Monmouth area. I've gone to tons of local shows over the last seven years, and what I saw on these sites was not truly representative of the vast majority of bands in and around Salem. Almost all of the musicians I saw on these sites were people you would hire for a wedding, a company event, or a party, which is why I'm guessing no one I know has ever heard of these websites. 


Those that I've talked to who frequently play live shows tell me that the process for scheduling something can be a hassle, and having to go through all the steps every time prevents them from playing as often as they'd like. You need to either meet in person or somehow obtain the owner's contact information, decide whether or not the venue is a good fit for you, ask to play a show, prove that you can actually play music by sending clips or playing for them in person, then try to agree on a date that works for both parties. This can sometimes take days or even weeks. Using one application for this whole process would be much more streamlined, professional, and easy. It would no longer take days to schedule a one-hour show since all of the needed information would be laid out cleanly in one place. I know that people would use this, as I know several musicians who play shows around Salem that have complained about the process of booking a show, and have told me that an application like this would be incredibly helpful.


There are a lot of features we could incorporate to make this application really useful and really cool. I want venue owners and musicians to be able to send direct messages to each other. I want to incorporate a rating system. I want venue owners and musicians to be able to view each other's schedules to choose dates that work for BOTH of them. I think it would be great if we could also allow venue owners to pay musicians they booked through the site later down the line. Or maybe even offer paid accounts, which would boost your visibility. 


We need a way for musicians to show their work, so we will need to use the Youtube, Instagram, and/or SoundCloud API to allow for that. It would also be useful for musicians to see how far a venue is from their current location, and to view the venue's location on a map. For this, I think we'd need to use Google Maps API, or possibly a different GPS. We would also need to use something in order to allow people to make payments through the site. Finally, for the algorithmic aspect of the project, we should recommend musicians to venue owners (and visa-versa) based on who they have booked before. We could take into account their rating, music genre, how many shows they've played, where they play most often, and possibly some other factors to produce a list of musicians/venues that would most likely be a good fit.


Most of this fits with things we have done before, but there are some features here which will require some independent study. I feel that the project is big and complex enough for this class, but still manageable. And I know that this is applicable to the real world, and people would use it. Overall, I'd estimate this would be a 7 or 8 level difficulty, and would make a great senior project.



### 3. Make-up Tutorial Application

What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
I believe it's always true that everyone wants to have a neat and better looking in daily their daily lives. Same to me. I really enjoy watching all kinds of make-up/cosmetic videos to 
self taught how to do make-up appropriate in different occasions. So far I couldn't find a website where will have the whole categories of differnet make-up tutorial styles. Youtube is pretty much
the main place I will go ahead to search and watch all those tutorials and tips whcih I feel we do need a place to gather all the fun and creative clips to make life eaier.
Along watching Jeffree star, Nikkie and some other great youtubers' chanels inspire me and let me realize there is a big amount of audience including both males and females.
People would spend time to wathch those videos and click those links to buy related cosmetic products. 

Having a website/app to help people to find the make-up style they want and they can fit into specific occasion would be a great idea. Provide the links and have the feature to compare the price of cosmetics
products will be highly appreciated by users. I havn't been able to find anyone has done a similar project and I feel it would be really fun to explore more funtions of it in the future. I would see the big amount of 
need from the market and everyone would love to use it if it will bring people convenience, save money and make you look better. 


Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?


I think it would be a really fun project and worthy to continue. Firstly, there doesn't exit an website could help people gather a fully range make-up self-taught info from Asian style to American style, from wedding to funerals, from Christmas to halloween, for all genders.
Make-up and cosmetics are always the trend and will update very quickly. I'd people will never get tired of pursuing the fashion. The huge market of it.

What are a few major features?
1. Using API from Youtube, Sephora, Allure, Ipsy, amazon etc..///I also need a big datebase to support this website

2. Dropdown list of a fully catogeries of differnt make-up styles.

3. Search Bar, by searchig keyword of make-up style, being able to find the specific make-up style/tutorial videos.

4. Search Bar, by searchig keyword of specific cosmetics, being able to find related make-up style/tutorial videos.

5. Applying AI to recognize your face shape to automatically match the style.

6. Have links of those cosmetics have been metioned in the videos and the feature to compare the price of them from different sites.

7. Place to leave comments and replies. Like and unlike the video/related cosmetics.

8. Using AI/Being able to show your face wearing the specific make up.

9. Have some differnrent background settings and be able to put the animation figure with your own face in differnt setting. Just for fun to make a picture.



What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.

Asp.net MVC5, Sql Server, Photoshop, Some AI techniques(Accord.Net), prolog etc.


What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)
Definitely Sorts alogrithms. Merge Sort for price somparison
